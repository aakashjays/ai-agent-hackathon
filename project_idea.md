# Project Title: Web3 AutoAgent

## Goal:
To create an AI Agent that automates tasks in Web3 trading & network management. It will monitor real-time market data, detect trading signals, and automate actions like alerts, analysis, and maybe even simple trades.

## Problem:
Web3 is fast. Traders and devs miss opportunities or react slowly. We need an AI that watches and acts smartly.

## Target Users:
- Crypto traders
- DeFi users
- Web3 developers

## Features:
- Real-time crypto market monitoring using APIs
- Automatic trend detection (AI analysis of price patterns)
- Signal generation & Telegram/Discord alerts
- Optional: Execute small safe trades (like buy/sell based on confidence levels)

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- Web3.py / Alchemy API
- LangChain (for AI logic)
- GPT-4 (for interpretation, decisions)
- Telegram Bot or Discord Bot (for alerts)
- MongoDB / JSON storage (for memory/logs)

## Stretch Goals:
- Integrate MetaMask wallet (simulation mode)
- Use NLP to give trading tips
- Auto-news summarizer (feeds to your agent)

## Milestones:
- 🗓️ Week 1: Setup + fetch crypto data + agent foundation
- 🗓️ Week 2: Build AI signal logic + alert system
- 🗓️ Week 3: Add automation (actions) + UI
- 🗓️ Week 4: Final polish + deploy demo
